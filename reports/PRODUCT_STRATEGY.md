# 🎯 Product Strategy & Success Criteria

## 1. Product Maturity Model
OffroadTerrain AI follows a 4-stage maturity progression:
1. **MVP**: Basic UNet segmentation on static images.
2. **Reactive V1**: Pathway ingestion for real-time inference.
3. **Calibrated V2**: Logit Bias Calibration (LBC) for hazard detection accuracy.
4. **Enterprise V3**: Dockerized, CI/CD-integrated, multi-node streaming platform.

## 2. Success Criteria (KPIs)
- **Safety**: 100% detection of "Rock" and "Water" classes within 2 meters of the vehicle.
- **Throughput**: Support for 30 FPS high-resolution imagery on a single RTX 3090.
- **Robustness**: Maintain >70% mIoU across "Dust", "Rain", and "Overexposure" simulated augmentations.

## 3. Governance & Contribution
Managed under strict **Open Source standards** to ensure rapid iteration and community trust.
