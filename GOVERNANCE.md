# 🦅 Project Governance

OffroadTerrain AI is an open-governance project focused on the safety and reliability of autonomous systems.

## 1. Decision Making
Technical decisions are made based on **Evidence-Based Metrics** (mIoU, Inference Latency). Proposals are vetted against the `docs/architecture.md` principles.

## 2. Contribution
See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for coding standards. Final merges require passing the `Makefile` validation suite.

## 3. Transparency
All strategic reports (`reports/`) are public and audit-certified by the core engineering team.
