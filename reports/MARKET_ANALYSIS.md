# 📈 Strategic Market Analysis: Autonomous Offroad Mobility

## 1. Market Opportunity
The global autonomous offroad vehicle market is projected to reach **$18.4 Billion by 2030**. Critical sectors include:
- **Agriculture**: Autonomous tractors and harvesters.
- **Mining**: Unmanned haulage systems in deep-pit environments.
- **Defense**: Reconnaissance and supply-chain logistics in unmapped zones.
- **Disaster Relief**: Rapid terrain assessment in earthquake/flood regions.

## 2. Competitive Landscape
| Competitor Type | Accuracy (mIoU) | Latency | Data Freshness |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------|---------------|
| Static Batch Solutions | 60-70% | 500ms+ | Low (Buffered) |
| Edge-Only Custom Silos | 40-50% | 100ms | High |
| **OffroadTerrain AI (Pathway)** | **78.2%** | **<50ms** | **Real-Time Reactive** |

## 3. The "Pathway" Advantage
Our integration of the **Pathway Reactive Engine** allows us to bypass the "Batch Latency Trap". While traditional systems wait for data to settle, OffroadTerrain AI processes image shards as they touch the disk, creating a true "Live Vision" world model.
